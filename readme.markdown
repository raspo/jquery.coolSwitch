## A jQuery plugin to create cool-looking switches
coolSwitch is a pretty basic plugin that converts boring `select` element into a switch. The `select` must have two options.

The switch acts as a *skin* and will update any value changes to the actual `select` element.


The plugin is working fine but still needs some final touches.

####TODO:
1. Set up a demo page
2. Add more themes
3. Add an option to specify the theme
4. Test on older browser
